What is Zabbix Security Insights?

Zabbix Security Insight is a solution that implements Zabbix, UserParameter, Yum Security plugin to collect and generate a view of security environment for a better management and compliance in Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers and derivated. This solution was tested in Zabbix 2.0, 2.2, 2.4 and 3.0 and actually 
works in RHEL and derivated distribution.

  This is the zabbix agent cofiguration file

- zabbix_agentd.userparams.conf
  File used to extend zabbix agent funcionality using UserParameter

- Zabbix Security Insights for RHEL.xml
  This is the Zabbix template to collect items from UserParameter. This template contain itens, triggers and graphics

- zbxgen-secreport
  This is the script responsible to generate sec-report and vuln-report files. These reports will be saved in /var/log/zabbix/security-reports/  for future queries.
    
    * sec-report: this file will store the number of erratas by severity, total and enhancements
    * vul-report: this file will store the package, its vulnerability including the CVE and the  package version that will fix the vulnerability

- zbxcheck-vuln
  This is a script responsible to query the vulnerabilities collected by /var/log/zabbix/security-reports/vuln-report and show in the Zabbix Dashboard as soon as you want. If you have a item collected with valor greater than "0", a trigger will be fired and a message will be showed in the dashboard. In the last 20 issues, you will be able to run a script to check the vulnerabilities reported by the triggers.
